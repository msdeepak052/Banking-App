Real-Time DevOps Banking App Project

    I want to build a real-time DevOps project using a CI/CD pipeline. For this, I need a sample three-tier banking application similar to HDFC or ICICI net banking.

    The application should:

        Be built using Python, Node.js, or Java (any of these is fine).

        Follow a three-tier architecture:

            Web Tier – Handles UI and login (e.g., HTML/CSS/JavaScript).

            App Tier – Backend logic in Python/Node/Java.

            DB Tier – Use Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL).

        Have a working login system, where username and password are stored in the application code.

        Allow users to:

            Log in

            Save data (e.g., user details, dummy transaction info)

            Perform dummy transactions

            View a transaction statement

    Requirements:

        Step-by-step instructions to develop the application, including:

            Web layer

            Application layer

            Database schema (MSSQL)

        The application must connect to pods in Kubernetes, and be fully functional within that environment.

        Each component (web, app, db) should be containerized using Docker and then:

            Packaged as separate images

            Deployed into a Kubernetes cluster

        There should be a proper CI/CD pipeline set up to:

            Build

            Test

            Push images to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub)

            Deploy into Kubernetes using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps

    Please provide thorough, step-by-step instructions for:

        Application development (with proper folder structure)

        MSSQL DB configuration

        Dockerization of all tiers

        Kubernetes deployment manifests (YAML files)

        CI/CD pipeline setup

    The final goal is to have a fully functional banking web app running on Kubernetes, using a CI/CD pipeline and capable of real login and dummy transactions.
